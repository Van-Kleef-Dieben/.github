    negative space

    our digital lives

    pause and stillness amidst the constant flow

    the space between

    reflection, contemplation, reconnection with oneself

    silence

    imperfection, impermanence, simplicity

    disconnect from device

    quiet moments, mundane experiences

    impermanence and transience of things

    fleeting satisfaction, constantly seeking new stimuli.

    limitations, true fulfillment
